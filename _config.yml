  Hi, I am Peng Jiang, a PhD student in Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. 
  
  My research interests include multitask learning & lifelong learning, task compositionality & generalization, neural representation & representation alignment, brain & LLM, and mechanistic interpretability. 
  
  I am curious about how can the intelligent systems (brain & LLM) can retain learned knowledge from previous tasks and use it to facilitate future learning. To further understand this, I am currently working on studying task representation in both brain & LLM from the perspective of task compositionality, which I believe is a promising approach to explain generalization.  Additionally, I hope to discover similar underlying mechanisms of task representation in brain & LLM.

          I am supervised by Prof. Xiaoxuan Jia in [Neural coding lab](https://jiaxx.github.io/). 
          In Jiaxx lab, I have explored different topics: visual coding, dimensionality reduction, neural dynamics, communication subspace across brain areas, RNN etc.
          Now I'm foucsing on understanding multitask representation in the view of task compositionality in different learning systems (brain & LLM).

          In [Wei Zhang lab](https://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1035/1267.htm), I studied neural mechanism of social space behaviour of drosophila and tried to develop a new tools for inhibiting function of single synapse.

          In [Bo Hong lab](http://neuro.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/), I completed my undergraduate thesis project, "Construct spiking neural network model for information communication between the hippocampus and the temporal lobe".

          To understand the updating and reuse of knowledge in lifelong learning, it is essential to grasp how learning systems represent the relatedness of tasks. 
          The foundational ideas include:
          - Multitask representation can be decomposed into sparse, independent features, with each task represented by a combination of different features. 
          - Upon learning a new task, the system may utilize existing sparse features or introduce new ones.

          Further topics include:
          - In the brain
            - Does the brain employ a similar mechanism to represent task relatedness?
            - Is there a communication subspace spanned by several task features across brain areas for information transfer?
          - In LLM:
            - Do LLMs utilize a similar mechanism to represent task relatedness?
            - How can we bridge multitask representation between the parameter space and activation space?
