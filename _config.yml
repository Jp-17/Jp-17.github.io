  Hi, I am Peng Jiang, a PhD student in Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. 
  
  My research interests include lifelong learning, task compositionality, generalization, neural representation & representation alignment. 
  
  I am curious about how can the intelligent systems (brain & AI) retain learned knowledge from previous tasks and use it to help future learning. To further understand this, I am currently working on studying task representation change during lifelong learning in the view of task compositionality. I will also explore the representation alignment between different learning systems (brain, pre-trained model and RNN).

          I am supervised by Prof. Xiaoxuan Jia in [Neural coding lab](https://jiaxx.github.io/). 
          In Jiaxx lab, I have explored different topics: visual coding, dimensionality reduction, neural dynamics, communication subspace across brain areas, RNN etc.
          Now I'm foucsing on understanding task representation change during lifelong learning in the view of task compositionality.

          In [Wei Zhang lab](https://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1035/1267.htm), I studied neural mechanism of social space behaviour of drosophila and tried to develop a new tools for inhibiting function of single synapse.

          In [Bo Hong lab](http://neuro.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/), I completed my undergraduate thesis project, "Construct spiking neural network model for information communication between the hippocampus and the temporal lobe".

          To understand knowledge update and reuse in lifelong learning, we have to understand how knowledge represent of task relatedness in learning systems. 
          We can study task relatedness representation in both parameter space and representation space. 
          Here I will focus on weight disentanglement in parameter space and feature disentanglement in representation space to understand task relatedness representation. 

          - How task representation change in both brain and neural network (pre-trained model, RNN) during lifelong learning?
          - How to bridge task representation in parameter space and representation space?
          - How similar task representation change is in brain and neural network?

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.
