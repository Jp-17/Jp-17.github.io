## About Me（原始版本）

Hi, I am Peng Jiang, a PhD student in Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

My research interests include multitask learning & lifelong learning, task compositionality & generalization, neural representation & representation alignment, brain & LLM, and mechanistic interpretability.

I am curious about how can the intelligent systems (brain & LLM) can retain learned knowledge from previous tasks and use it to facilitate future learning. To further understand this, I am currently working on studying task representation from the perspective of task compositionality, which I believe is a promising approach to explain generalization. Additionally, I hope to discover the similar underlying mechanisms of multitask representation in brain & LLM.

## Education（原始版本）

### 清华大学（2021 - now）
- PhD candidate, Computational Neuroscience
- Supervised by Prof. Xiaoxuan Jia in [Neural coding lab](https://jiaxx.github.io/)
- In Jiaxx lab, I have explored different topics: visual coding, dimensionality reduction, neural dynamics, communication subspace across brain areas, RNN etc.
- Now I'm focusing on understanding multitask representation in the view of task compositionality in different learning systems (brain & LLM).

> At the neural coding lab, we seek to understand how information is represented and processed in the brain to support flexible perception and behavior. Our research lies at the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning and psychology.

### 清华大学（2017 - 2021）
- BSc, Major in Life Sciences, Minor in Computer Science
- In [Wei Zhang lab](https://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1035/1267.htm), studied neural mechanism of social space behaviour of drosophila and tried to develop a new tools for inhibiting function of single synapse.
- In [Bo Hong lab](http://neuro.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/), completed undergraduate thesis: "Construct spiking neural network model for information communication between the hippocampus and the temporal lobe".

## Projects（原始版本）

### Task Representation Project
> Discover the essence of intelligence, abstraction and generalization.

To understand the updating and reuse of knowledge in lifelong learning, it is essential to grasp how learning systems represent the relatedness of tasks.

The foundational ideas include:
- Multitask representation can be decomposed into sparse, independent features, with each task represented by a combination of different features.
- Upon learning a new task, the system may utilize existing sparse features or introduce new ones.

Further topics include:
- In the brain:
  - Does the brain utilize a similar mechanism to represent task relatedness?
  - Is there a communication subspace spanned by shared task features across brain areas for information transfer?
- In LLM:
  - Do LLMs utilize a similar mechanism to represent task relatedness?
  - How can we bridge multitask representation between the parameter space and activation space?
